      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Salmon is the common name for several commercially important species of euryhaline ray-finned fish from the genera Salmo and Oncorhynchus of the family Salmonidae, native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (Salmo) and North Pacific (Oncorhynchus) basins.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>salmon</li>
        <li>solt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Grab a large, shallow plate (like a pie dish) and combine the flour, salt, and pepper. Pat your fillets dry and sprinkle additional salt over the top.</li>
        <li>Melt your butter in a large oven-safe skillet. Swirl the pan a few times until the butter starts to brown. This will create irresistible flavor!</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low, and dredge both sides of the fillets in the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>Gently lay your fillets in the melted butter, top-side down. Cook undisturbed until golden brown. Once the salmon turns opaque on the sides and begins to turn opaque on top, flip it over.</li>
        <li>Add your lemon zest and lemon juice to the skillet, and place it into the oven. After 6 minutes, remove the skillet from the oven, cover it with foil, and let it rest. (Your salmon will continue to cook while it rests.)</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, place each fillet on a plate, and spoon the sauce from the pan over the top. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and capers, then enjoy immediately. Donâ€™t forget to take a moment to revel in your delicious culinary triumph!</li>
      </ol>
